        <h1>Childhood immunisations and six week check</h1>
        <p>The childhood immunisations extract provides the <a href="https://www.nelft.nhs.uk/services-waltham-forest-child-health-administration" target="_blank">North East London Child Health Information Service</a> (CHIS) Hub with child heath data from Waltham Forest CCG GP systems.</p>
        <p>The DDS delivers an extract that contains changes in  GP&#160;immunisation and six week baby check data as specified in the required datasets. </p>
        <p>The daily extract (delta) provides an update on changes made to the defined criteria over the past 24 hours; so that the hub and GP systems are in sync.</p>
        <p>The extract includes data from all patients who are aged between 0-19 years old and who are registered at Waltham Forest CCG GP practices.</p>
