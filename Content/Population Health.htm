        <p>Population Health is designed to support advanced cohort query and large scale output reports.</p>
        <p>Population Health functionality supports a number of secondary uses; in particular where there is a need to analyse linked primary and acute data, and gives publishers better access to their own data for direct care purposes.</p>
        <p>Within the library hierarchical folder structure, you can create your own folders and subfolders, and include specific code sets, cohorts, and reports.</p>
        <p>In Cohorts, you can add a query and specify your required reporting population. For example, you can create a query that only returns those patients with Asthma or those within a specific age range.</p>
        <p>In Quality Indicators, you can add quality and outcomes framework (QOF) queries that will return a register of patients for a particular QOF indicator. For example, you can create a QOF query for Diabetes mellitus (DM) or Blood pressure (BP). You can also trend, and graphically display, previously run quality indicator queries using the Cohort Results Trend Dashboard.</p>
        <p>Population Health includes:</p>
