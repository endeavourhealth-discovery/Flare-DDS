        <h1>Diabetes retinopathy recall</h1>
        <h2>Project summary</h2>
        <p>Homerton University Hospital manages and provides the North East London Diabetes Eye Screening Programme.  This aims to identify sight-threatening diabetic eye disease at a treatable stage, to prevent blindness in people with diabetes.  Up to date lists of ‘everyone with diabetes’ in local CCG areas are needed to ensure that diabetes eye screening is offered to everyone who needs it, and that people who have left the area don’t have redundant and wasteful appointments sent to their former NE London address.</p>
        <h2>Project population</h2>
        <p>All patients who are registered at practices in Barking and Dagenham, Havering, Redbridge, and Waltham Forest CCGs.
