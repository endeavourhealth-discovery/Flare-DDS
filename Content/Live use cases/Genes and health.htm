        <h1>East London Genes and Health</h1>
        <h2>Project summary</h2>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.genesandhealth.org/" target="_blank">East London Genes and Health</a> (ELG&amp;H) study aims to improve the health of people of Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage by analysing the genes and health of 100,000 local people. </p>
        <p>The DDS genes and health extract provides relevant genomic and phenomic research information from patient GP electronic health record (with the consent of the GP practice data controllers in 4 CCGs - Newham, City and Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest).</p>
        <p>The research aims are to study:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">how genes normally vary from person to person in the adult Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities. Knowing what is normal is very important when searching for genes causing certain childhood diseases.</li>
            <li class="bullets">genes in people with very high and very low cholesterol levels, to better understand why heart disease and stroke occur.</li>
            <li class="bullets">variation in genes in healthy adults whose parents are related. These studies will tell us how genes work (especially knockouts), and help develop new medicines and treatments.</li>
            <li class="bullets">genes of people with diabetes, aiming to identify rarer types of diabetes for which specific treatments might be used.</li>
            <li class="bullets">how some people respond differently to certain medicines.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Project population</h2>
        <p>GP records available within the following CCGs: Tower Hamlets, Newham, Waltham Forest and City &amp; Hackney.</p>
        <h2>Project cohort</h2>
        <p> People of Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage.</p>
        <h2>Project criteria</h2>
        <p>How are we looking for those patients? Which codes?</p>
        <h2>Data state</h2>
        <p>Patient identifiable.</p>
