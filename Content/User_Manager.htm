        <p>User Manager is a web application that allows end users to manage user accounts and roles. It uses the Discovery authentication server, which supports two factor authentication and single sign-on of users, and is based on modern security protocols such as OAuth2 protocol, Open ID Connect and FIDO.</p>
        <p>Logged on users can edit their own user profile details such as name, password, telephone number, and photograph.</p>
        <p>Admin users can also add, edit, and delete users within their own organisation group, and create and assign roles to determine other user's application profile access.</p>
