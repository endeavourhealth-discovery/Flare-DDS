        <h1>Data Sharing Manager</h1>
       
        <p>The Discovery Data Service (DDS) receives data from source organisations (publishers), transforms the data into a common model, stores the data, and then distributes the data to organisations (subscribers), subject to data sharing agreements, consent and satisfactory security arrangements.</p>
        <p>Data Sharing Manager is a web application that is used both by administrators and end users to view and configure the data agreements and data flows through the service. The application consists of a number of modules that manage the concepts and relationships as described below. Access to the module and module functions are determined by an authorisation mechanism based on a user’s role based attributes (or access profile). The following high level concepts are managed by the Data Sharing Manager:</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li class="bullets">Region - a grouping construct for a set of organisations or other regions.</li>
            <li class="bullets">Organisation - an organisation with an NHS ODS code.</li>
            <li class="bullets">Services - a named service providing care, linked to an organisation, acting as publisher or subscriber.</li>
            <li class="bullets">Data sharing agreement - the overarching agreement between a set of publishers and subscribers.</li>
            <li class="bullets">Data flow agreements - the agreement between publishers and subscribers to exchange data in a specific way. Data sharing agreements have many data flows.</li>
            <li class="bullets">Data set - the specification of data content used in a data flow. Data flow agreements have many data sets (depending on role).</li>
            <li class="bullets">Role - a role related to a person’s right/ need to access particular data set in the context of a data flow.</li>
            <li class="bullets">Consent model - the consent model relating to a particular data flow.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Data Sharing Manager provides a visual representation of data that is being shared and processed and by which organisations, regions, and/or services. You can also amend or cancel data sharing and processing agreements in real time.</p>

        <p>This example map shows the geographic location of publishers of data into the Discovery Data Service. Red pin icons  <img src="Resources/Images/pin.png" style="width: 13px;height: 20px;" /> denote individual organisations. Blue (&lt;10) <img src="Resources/Images/m1.png" style="width: 28px;height: 28px;" /> and yellow (&gt;=10) <img src="Resources/Images/m2.png" style="width: 28px;height: 28px;" /> cluster icons denote a number of organisations in close proximity.</p>
