        <h1>Information Model  – language and structural specification</h1>
        <p><b>Last update:</b> 16 January 2020</p>
        <h1 class="numbered">Introduction</h1>
        <h2 class="numbered">Objectives of the information model</h2>
        <p>The objectives of the information model are to:</p>
        <p>1.	Enable users to visualise and understand the structure and content of health records. The users should not have to be technical experts or informaticians.</p>
        <p>2.	Provide a specification of structure and content  for systems that store or query health data.</p>
        <p>3.	To create a single unified language (subset of UML and description logic) that is both human readable and machine interpretable to represent the structure, content and query.</p>
        <p>4.	To provide an ontology (or set of ontologies) which can be used by reasoners and subsumption query to support advanced analytics.</p>
        <p>5.	To provide a means of specifying the transforms or mappings between data sets or to define reports that extract data from data sets.</p>
        <p>It is possible to envisage health record entries as an unlimited  set of concepts each with an unlimited set of properties or relationships, each with an unlimited set of values or relationship targets.</p>
        <p>Such a mechanism would be difficult to make sense of. For example, dates may be represented in thousands of different ways and it may not be clear what a particular date refers to. Visualisation of patterns, such as that used by the Internet search engines, would not meet requirements.</p>
        <p>The information model seeks to make sense of the plethora of data points by categorising attributes and values, and organising them in a way that meets people’s perception of the information contained in the record stores.</p>
        <p>In addition, the information model  provides machine interpretable instructions to implementors when designing data bases or data sets.</p>
        <h1 class="numbered">What is an information model?</h1>
        <p>A model is a representation of something real.</p>
        <p>An information model is a model of information. Information is a description of an arrangement of data for particular purposes.</p>
        <p>More specifically, in this context, an information model is tailored to illustrate arrangements of health and care data as held in health records for the purposes of understanding and query.</p>
        <p>In order to build a system there is a need for an architectural designs. In software terms an architectural design is an “abstract model”.  The information model structure can thus be considered an abstract model.</p>
        <p>The effect of the information model is to form a bridge between the human conception of health care records and the machine-based implementation of those records so that data within the records can be accessed and used more easily and efficiently by people who need information.</p>
        <p>In order to bridge the conceptual gap, the model creates a series of machine interpretable conceptualisations, each of which gets closer to an underlying machine readable logical information model, which itself then maps directly to implementation schemas and query languages, whether they be relational, graph or other.</p>
        <h2 class="numbered">The model uses a layered approach.</h2>
        <h2 class="numbered">One way of illustrating the components model is to consider it as a set of building blocks.</h2>
