        <h1>Frailty API</h1>
        <p>The following graph shows the number of patients that have been flagged as potentially frail and have therefore been fast tracked to speak directly to a clinician who can provide personalised care.</p>
        <p>The graph shows the cumulative totals and the percentage of potentially frail patients compared to the total number of matched patients.</p>
