        <p>This page provides an overview of the Discovery Data Model and specifies the requirements that the common data model must meet.</p>
        <h2>Common data model overview</h2>
        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>The common data model helps to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">visualise and easily understand the types of health data held  in an individual’s health record.</li>
            <li class="bullets">visualise and easily understand the types of data held across a population.</li>
            <li class="bullets">apply a query at both an individual and a population level so that the  query definition can be shared, scrutinised, and reused across a number of different implementations.</li>
            <li class="bullets">rapidly design and implement systems that store and access health data that is derived from multiple source systems from both the individual and population health perspective.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How the model helps to achieve the objectives</h3>
        <p>The common data model is key to  achieving the objectives</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">visualise and easily understand the types of health data held  in an individual’s health record.</li>
