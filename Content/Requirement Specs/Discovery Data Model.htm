        <p>This page provides an overview of the Discovery Data Model and specifies the requirements that the common data model must meet.</p>
        <h2 class="numbered">Common data model overview</h2>
        <p>The common data model has an open and transparent design, includes a wide breadth of data types, and is human readable.</p>
        <h3 class="numbered">Objectives</h3>
        <p>The common data model enables you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">visualise and easily understand the types of health data held  in an individual’s health record.</li>
            <li class="bullets">visualise and easily understand the types of data held across a population.</li>
            <li class="bullets">apply a query at both an individual and a population level so that the  query definition can be shared, scrutinised, and reused across a number of different implementations.</li>
            <li class="bullets">rapidly design and implement systems that store and access health data that is derived from multiple source systems from both the individual and population health perspective.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="numbered">How the model helps to achieve the objectives</h3>
        <p>The common data model is key to  achieving the objectives by enabling other software applications to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">provide visual representations of health data held  in an individual’s health record.</li>
            <li class="bullets">provide model navigation including conventional folder based navigation or node/ graph navigation with free text search support.</li>
            <li class="bullets">provide a multi-taxonomy approach to categorising data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The common data model also supports:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">constrained and simple query definitions through associated data points.</li>
            <li class="bullets">links to summary statistics to give insights into likely query results prior to the execution of queries.</li>
            <li class="bullets">user defined views - from a wizard based approach to simple, or advanced, queries.</li>
            <li class="bullets">end users to specify data extract requirements using database query languages, including graph based, in query arguments.</li>
            <li class="bullets">many record store technologies such as relational, column based, or graph based.</li>
            <li class="bullets">a library of predefined query definitions and related artefacts such as code sets, which can be distributed and accessed independently of other technologies.</li>
            <li class="bullets">sharing of query logic across any community regardless of whether or not the queries are applied to model conformant record stores.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="numbered">What the model is not</h3>
        <p>The common data model is not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">a proposed standard for storing or communicating electronic health records.<br /><b>Note:</b> The model organises data that has been stored; the categorisation is determined by information requirements and attribute patterns in the submitted data.</li>
            <li class="bullets">a semantic ontology - the model is semantically passive.<br /><b>Note:</b> The model does include ontologies but it is the responsibility of the source ontology, such as Snomed-CT to make sure that the meanings of the concepts are consistent.</li>
            <li class="bullets">a proposed approach to entering or displaying data.<br /><b>Note:</b> the model recognises and categorises the patterns created when data is entered.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="numbered">Requirements</h2>
        <p><b>Important:</b> The words <i>must</i> and <i>will</i> imply mandatory requirements.</p>
        <h3 class="numbered">Scope of the Data Model</h3>
        <p>The Data Model must be capable of supporting:</p>
