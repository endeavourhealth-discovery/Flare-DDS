        <p>The collaboration between the  Ripple and Discovery teams enables the Helm Patient Portal to access GP data from practices using Vision, TPP, and EMIS from a single source.</p>
        <p><a href="https://ripple.foundation/" target="_blank">Ripple Foundation</a> is a clinically led team working towards and supporting the move to an open platform fit for 21st century health and care. Supporting open source, open standards and an open architecture that can be used worldwide.</p>
        <p>We are supporting those people who are working to change 21st century health and care. They include clinical, business and technical leaders who have a need and/or want to service that need.</p>
        <p>We are supporting the process of building the community who want to collaborate around this open platform mission. We want to challenge the limitations of the current limited health and care IT market, positively disrupt and move health and care towards a services orientated marketplace. We are supporting those key technologies that we believe should be open sourced to benefit the health and care world.</p>
        <p>Ripple Foundation is actively supporting key open platform projects in order to further this mission.</p>
        <p>Ripple and Discovery are exploring opportunities where we can partner together.</p>
        <p>Our first project is a proof of concept for the Helm Portal that will help people to better manage and control their own care and wellbeing, and help to prevent further health issues in the following ways:</p>
        <ul class="ripple">
            <li class="ripple">It is an innovative platform for viewing, controlling and contributing to their own health and wellbeing information.</li>
            <li class="ripple">It will be the first time the public have been able to have access to a system that joins up all their medical information from the NHS with council services and more, with one single login.</li>
            <li class="ripple">Citizens will have the ability to add information they believe and/or their care professional has asked them to record to help manage a health condition and improve their wellbeing.</li>
            <li class="ripple">It will revolutionise access to personal data, starting with medical information and growing from there.</li>
            <li class="ripple">Easy to use; interactive; ability to interface with apps and devices; personaliseable and with granular privacy settings; secure; supported.</li>
            <li class="ripple">It is built on an open platform with a set of principles, which include open standards, and is vendor and technology neutral.  Allowing it to scale and expand both geographically and in terms of connectivity.</li>
            <li class="ripple">It will encourage a marketplace to create apps and functionality that will work with the open platform because they conform to the standards set. Opening up the health and care system to SMEs that struggle to enter and innovate in this sector.</li>
            <li class="ripple">This could in time allow citizens to be the conduit of the information they can share, which allows researchers, universities etc fantastic opportunities to access currently untapped data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the future, it will become the hub for all public services that rely on citizens to contribute to and manage data and information.</p>
