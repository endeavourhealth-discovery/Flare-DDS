				Our goal is to improve health outcomes to give patients an opportunity for a better life, improve service utilisation to give the health systems the potential to deliver better outcomes and, at the same time, make them financially sustainable. 
 
				We chose to create a digital service to achieve this and named it 'VitruCare'. It is a Patient Engagement Platform that uses evidence based psychology to engage and motivate patients into co-creating healthcare, supports HCPs in co-ordinating service provision, and improves productivity and outcomes all round. Clinical studies demonstrate health outcome improvements.
